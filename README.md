## Happy Saturday! ‚ú® Thanks for vising my GitHub.
I'm Ali, a second-year graduate student studying [computer science and public policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/). As a data professional with over four years of experience, I'm commited to using my coding skills to inspire data-informed decisions and engineer human-centered software for social good.

### Currently Working On

üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ School Projects
  - Modeling Bayesian methods for statistical analysis in Python
  - Analyzing the emerging risks of technological advancements from a public policy perspective
  - Exploring computer achitecture from the perspective of a high performance programmer

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Work Projects
  - Mentoring and project managing 2 undergraduate and 2 graduate students building a convolutional neural network in PyTorch to classify neutrino activity in partnership with the Fermi Lab
  - Mentoring and project managing 2 undergraduate and 2 graduate students conducting exploratory data analysis on the health and environmental risks of pesticides in partnership with the Hawai ªi Alliance for Progressive Action
  - Developing a web application that matches users with personalized, local volunteering opportunities to promote civic engagement
  - Consulting for the [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) on marketing projects to increase the school's reach and impact

### Past Projects

*Many repositories from school projects are private for academic integrity and intellectual property purposes. Code can be shared with prospective employers upon request.*

- Partnered with [FracTracker Alliance](https://www.fractracker.org/) to automatically send user-documented potentially harmful infrastructure activity to state environmental agencies, using a RESTful API in Flask
- Developed a genomic annotation service using Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and AWS, including S3, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, and Lambda functions
- Engineered an application detailing crimes in Chicago by type of weather using Hive, HBase, Hadoop, Thrift, and Kafka
- Built a website about the James Webb Space Telescope using React, node.js, and JavaScript
- Partnered with the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/), [BankTrack](banktrack.org), and [Inclusive Development International](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/) to scrape the SEC's website, clean text from 8-K forms, and extract relevant information using NLP models, laying the groundwork for future students to build a searchable database of commercial bank loans that can be used to hold banks accountable for the projects in which they invest
- Developed a web application to view Chicago restaurant inspection data using a RESTful API, PostgreSQL, and Flask, including engineering an SQLite3 database utilizing record linkage
- Trained a neural network in PyTorch to classify whether U.S. senators were likely to vote pro-environment on an upcoming bill based on their Tweets
- Built a suite of statistical models using scraped FEMA and ACS data focused on several natural disasters and the resulting aid to various locations using Dash and Plotly
