## Happy Thursday! ✨ Thanks for vising my GitHub.
I'm Ali, a second-year graduate student studying [computer science and public policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy. I was a digital marketer in my former life, but now hope to use my coding skills to inspire data-driven decision-making and engineer human-centered software for social good.
